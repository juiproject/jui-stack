# Welcome to the JUI Stack Documentation

**JUI Stack** is a full-stack web development framework built for Java developers. It enables you to create modern, browser-based applications entirely in Javaâ€”without requiring deep knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, or CSS. Using J2CL (Java to Closure), your Java code compiles to efficient JavaScript, allowing you to share logic seamlessly between client and server.

## About this Documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to working with the JUI Stack. It covers:

1. Core concepts and architecture of the JUI framework
2. How to build UI components using Java
3. Integration with backend services (e.g. Spring Boot)
4. Build and deployment tools
5. Advanced topics like routing, state management, and interop with native JavaScript

Whether you're just getting started or looking to dive into advanced features, this documentation is designed to guide you step-by-step.
