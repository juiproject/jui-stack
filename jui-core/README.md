# Overview

The **jui-core** project contains the component model implementation along with supporting classes and interfaces. This includes:

1. Component, control, state and layout mechanisms.
2. DOM rendering (the DOM builder).
4. A navigation mechansim (for implementing application navigation).
5. A file management mechanism (for file upload and download management).
5. Various utilities and support classes.

The purpose is to hold the foundation code for JUI so precludes (meaningful) components themselves. Actual components are available in the [jui-ui](../jui-ui/) project.
