# Overview

A collection of classes that can be used to construct a meta-template based on UI items that have a specific purpose (i.e. header, line item, etc).

A distinct advantage of these items is that they can shared and incorporated into other items.

When configured they are built out into a `Container` template node. From there they can be used to generate DOM when processing data.
